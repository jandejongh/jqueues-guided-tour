# jqueues-guided-tour
A Guided Tour to the JQueues Java package for Discrete-Event Simulation of Queueing Systems

### Introduction
The jqueues (https://github.com/jandejongh/jqueues) package and its dependency jsimulation (https://github.com/jandejongh/jsimulation) provide Java support for discrete-event simulation of queueing systems,
loosely modeled after Graham Birtwistle's DEMOS package for SIMULA.
Both projects have been released under Apache v2 License.
This project contains a guided tour to both packages.
This documentation, though, is released under a different LICENSE.

### Structure
This project's structure is that of a Maven project. The source code of the project consists of all compile-able examples introduced in the documentation. The LaTeX-based documentation itself is in the 'doc' subdirectory of the project.

### Contributions
Provided that you accept the LICENSE agreement, contributions to the text are more than welcome, as well as any feedback on the contents of the documentation. Please do not hesitate to contact me, or submit an issue, if the documentation is in any way unclear, incomplete or simply wrong.
